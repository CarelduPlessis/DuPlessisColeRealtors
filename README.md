# DuPlessisColeRealtors

 DuPlessisColeRealtors is a Team Project that I developed in 2019 as an Assignment for Vision College when I was a student.
 
 This Project Goal is to see if the student in a Team can build a CRUD (Create, READ, Update, Delete) Operations in a website using PHP, HTML, Javascript, CSS code.
 
I started Refactor this project on the 04/02/2022.

I rebuild the Database to add more allow more features and make it easier for user to use the website.

I made the forms look more modern and profesional. 


I will continue to make improvements and Test the website for bugs.
